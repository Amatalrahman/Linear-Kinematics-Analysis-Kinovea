##  Project Overview
We analyzed the **linear kinematics** of a challenging human motion sequence — including a **deep squat**, a **box jump**, and a **return movement** — using **Kinovea** software.

 Tracked joints: **Hip** & **Knee**  
 Parameters analyzed: 
- **Position** 
- **Velocity** 
- **Acceleration**

## 🎥 Video Selection and Commentary
After an extensive search for a high-quality motion clip, we selected a video from **Shutterstock** for its clear demonstration of dynamic movement and biomechanical richness.

✨ **What's special about our video?**
- Markers placed carefully on joints.
- A **segmentation line** drawn for precision.
- **Real-time explanatory commentary** during each motion phase!
